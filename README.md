Based on a system I remember using in ultma online comes a minecraft mod called Recall Stones.<br />
This mod adds new items and blocks that provides a system of stones that allow players to instantly teleport to another location in the world, or another.</p>

<p>With Thanks to Roxforbraynz who provided the textures!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 6px;"><strong>Stone Charge System</strong></span><br />
Before looking at the stones themselves you need to know about the charge system.<br />
Each stone can store ender charges in them. Each recall will use a certain amount of charge depending on the type of stone.<br />

To recharge the stone you just need to put it in a crafting grid with some ender pearls, each pearl adds 5 charges (Configurable in the config file) like so:<br />

<p><strong><em>Player Essence</em></strong><br />

Right click with this item will set the recall point of the stone to your current location.<br />
Right click again will transport you back to that position.<br />
There is a 10 second cool down time after each use and you can not use it to cross dimensions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dimension Recall Stone</em></strong><br />
Can store 25 charges and cost 5 per recall (Configurable in the config file).<br />

Works in the same way as the recall stone, but can also work across dimensions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dimension Recall Stone</em></strong><br />
Can store 100 charges and cost 25 per recall (Configurable in the config file).<br />

Crafted with a player essence. Will transport you to the player whose essence you made the stone with.<br />
